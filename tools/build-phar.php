/**
 * Builds `build/mdword.phar` — a single file that converts Markdown to Word,
 * and back, on a machine with nothing but PHP.
 *
 * ```sh
 * composer build:phar
 * ```
 *
 * The archive carries the library and its two runtime dependencies and nothing
 * else. The development dependencies are left out, which is most of why it is
 * around a megabyte rather than the tens of megabytes the test suite brings
 * with it — and the dependencies' own test suites, documentation and static
 * analysis configuration are pruned before they go in, so the archive is the
 * code that runs and nothing else.
 *
 * The dependencies are installed into a directory of their own rather than into
 * the project, because `composer install --no-dev` in the project would delete
 * the test tools from `vendor/` and the next `composer test` would fail.
 *
 * The build is reproducible: the same source tree produces the same bytes, so
 * two machines — or two runs on one — can be compared by checksum. See
 * `resolveEpoch()` and `normaliseTimestamps()` for what that costs; the short
 * version is that PHP's Phar extension stamps every entry with the time the
 * archive was written and offers no way to say otherwise, so the timestamps are
 * rewritten afterwards.
 *
 * `phar.readonly` is `On` in most PHP installations, which is the right default
 * and cannot be changed at runtime. Rather than refuse, this script re-runs
 * itself with the setting turned off for the length of the build, so that one
 * command works everywhere.

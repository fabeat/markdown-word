 * The suite-wide clean-up has to be registered through `pest()`.

 * In Pest 5 a bare `afterEach()` in tests/Pest.php binds to that file rather than

 * all written, and they are simply never removed. Reading the source is the only
 * way to notice, so the rule is pinned here.
 *
 * Only the negative half is asserted. A test that greps its own bootstrap for the
 * literal text `pest()->afterEach(` fails the moment anybody reformats the line
 * or writes it as `pest()->afterEach (` — a suite broken by whitespace, over
 * something that still works. What matters is that a hook not reached through
 * `pest()` is the defect, and it has several spellings, so all of them are
 * excluded.

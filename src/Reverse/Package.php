/**
 * Reads the parts of a `.docx` archive that describe a document's content.
 *
 * A `.docx` is a zip of XML parts. The reverse converter needs four of them —
 * the document itself, the relationship part that resolves hyperlinks and
 * images, the style definitions that say what a `w:pStyle` means, and the
 * numbering definitions that say what a `w:numId` means — and this class hands
 * them over as parsed documents without leaking the archive into the rest of the
 * code.
 *
 * The archive is not this library's, and a zip says how its contents are laid out
 * and nothing about how much room they will take up: forty kilobytes of a
 * document part is forty megabytes of paragraph, and the entry count is whatever
 * the writer felt like. So {@see Options::$maxPartBytes} and
 * {@see Options::$maxEntries} bound what is read before it is inflated, and the
 * archive is opened consistently rather than as far as the bytes happen to
 * stretch.

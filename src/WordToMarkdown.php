/**
 * Converts a Word document back into Markdown — the inverse of
 * {@see \MarkdownWord\MarkdownToWord}, so a document can be checked by converting
 * it to Word, back to Markdown, and comparing the text the reader ends up with.
 *
 * The round trip preserves what Word was told to keep and is honest about the
 * rest. These are the distinctions Word does not record, and README says each in
 * full with an example:
 *
 *  - a table's header row comes back bold, and its delimiter row is rewritten,
 *    though the column alignment itself survives;
 *  - a fenced code block comes back without its language, and one of a single
 *    line as an inline span instead;
 *  - a quote written as plain indentation rather than as a style comes back as a
 *    plain paragraph;
 *  - the last line has no newline after it.
 *
 * The document is not this library's: the names in it and the contents of what
 * it names are the sender's to choose. So the result is written from a staged
 * copy rather than opened in place, and an image is only written out once both
 * its name and its bytes say that it is an image.

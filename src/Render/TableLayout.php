/**
 * How wide a table may be, and how that width is shared out between its columns.
 *
 * A Markdown table carries no widths at all — GFM's delimiter row says alignment
 * and nothing else — so every viewer has to invent them, and the widths have to
 * be written into the document for Word to invent them the same way twice.
 *
 * Word invents them badly without help. Given a `w:tblGrid` of empty `w:gridCol`
 * elements and cells with no `w:tcW`, it has nothing to go on and narrows each
 * column to the least it can hold: one or two characters. Left alone it is also
 * free to widen a column past the page, which is why a cell used to be told not
 * to wrap — an accident that made Word size columns to their content and hid the
 * missing widths rather than filling them in.
